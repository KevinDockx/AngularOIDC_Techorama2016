# Techorama 2016: Angular, OAuth, OIDC demo
Demo code for my Techorama 2016 session: "Angular, OAuth2 and OpenID Connect, Heaven or Hell?" - May 4th, 2016, Techorama, Belgium

## Session description

A lot of applications these days are built with Angular, talking to an API. But how do you secure something like that? Which parts CAN you secure – ie: what makes sense? And is that simple custom token endpoint used for authorization *really* sufficient (note: probably not)? Learn how you can correctly use OAuth2 & OpenID Connect from an Angular application. We’ll look into what you should use, what the risks are, how to implement support for this, and – very important - what NOT to do. After this session, authorization & authentication for your Angular applications using OAuth2 & OpenID Connect should have no more secrets for you.
